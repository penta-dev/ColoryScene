We want a unity scene that are 15 meters long/deep and 5 meters white.
from floor to top we want 3 meter.
the walls shall be in purple nuances - and slowly shift to green and orange.
In the back of the room there is a square, thats a bit lighter than the room.

great. but its important its as low poly as possible, and that it has the measurements i asked for - and the square as well
